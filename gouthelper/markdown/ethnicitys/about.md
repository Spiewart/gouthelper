## <span id="about">About</span>

GoutHelper appreciates that race and ethnicity are sensitive subjects and that in modern medicine we should strive to avoid race-based judgement and predictions, as well as develop accurate assessments of health that are not dependent on race or ethnicity. However, GoutHelper has to ask about race / ethnicity because of the risk imparted by the [HLA-B\*5801](/labs/about/hlab5801/).

HLA-B\*5801 is a gene that when present increases an individual's risk of serious side effects with the most commonly used long-term gout medication: allopurinol[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). Having the HLA-B\*5801 gene is much more common in individuals who are often Asian descent[<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2). This was first described in Han Chinese, but has been subsequently observed in Korean and Thai populations. HLA-B\*5801 is also more common in African Americans[<sup>3</sup>](#ref-3).

Because of the risk associated with the HLA-B\*5801 genotype and its increased prevalence in the aforementioned races / ethnicities, GoutHelper has to ask about race / ethnicity in order to provide safe guidance to practitioners when selecting long-term gout therapies. This practice is in line with the 2020 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout, which recommends checking for the HLA-B\*5801 gene in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, Thai, or African American descent[<sup>4</sup>](#ref-4). Individuals with the gene should be started on a different medication if possible.
