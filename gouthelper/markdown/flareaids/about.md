## <span id="about">About</span>

Every person who suffers from gout should have a plan, via a physician or otherwise, for treating a gout flare in the event he or she has one. FlareAids are a decision aid to help patients and providers make a customized plan for treating a gout flare. They interpret a patient's information and provide a recommendation for the best treatment option. They are meant to be used by providers and/or patients. They are not meant to replace a provider's judgement.

Short-term treatment of gout flares is strictly for the benefit of the patient, meaning shorter and less severe symptoms. Gout flare treatments do not make the symptoms go away immediately. Short-term flare treatments do not change the likelihood of future flares. They are not meant to be used as a long-term treatment for gout.

The treatments basically boil down to NSAIDs, which are available over the counter or by prescription, colchicine, or prednisone, the latter two of which are also available only by prescription in the US.
