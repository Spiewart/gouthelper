## <span id="about">About</span>

Every person who suffers from gout should have a plan, via a physician or otherwise, for treating a gout flare in the event he or she has one. FlareAid is a Decision Aid to help patients and providers make a customized plan for treating a gout flare. It interprets a patient's information and provides a recommendation for the best treatment option.

See the [Flare Treatments](/treatments/about/flare/) page for more information about the treatments.

## <span id="factors">Factors</span>

FlareAid takes into account the following factors:

- **Patient's age** - NSAIDs are generally safe in younger patients, but should be used with caution in older patients. Age is also used to calculate kidney function when dosing colchicine.

- **Patient's gender** - Biological gender is used to calculate kidney function when dosing colchicine.

- **Cardiovascular disease** - NSAIDs are generally contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease.
  It's probably safe to use them for a limited, short-duration, but out of caution Gouthelper defaults to avoiding NSAIDs in patients with cardiovascular disease.

- **Anticoagulation** - NSAIDs can increase the risk of bleeding. Thus, anticoagulation is generally a contraindication to NSAID use.

- **Bleed** - NSAIDs can increase the risk of bleeding. Thus, a recent bleed or a history of a serious bleed is generally a contraindication to NSAID use.

- **Gastric gypass** - Patients who have had gastric bypass surgery are prone to developing ulcers at the site of their bypass. Thus, gastric bypass is generally a contraindication to NSAID use.

- **Inflammatory bowel disease** - There is some low-quality evidence that NSAIDs can worsen inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, inflammatory bowel disease is generally a contraindication to NSAID use.

- **Chronic kidney disease** - NSAIDs are generally contraindicated in patients with chronic kidney disease.
  Colchicine has to be dose-adjusted for patient's with early (under stage III) chronic kidney disease, but
  is contraindicated in patients with stage IV or V chronic kidney disease.

- **Colchicine interactions** - Colchicine has a long list of drug interactions, some of which are serious. Always double-check for interactions before prescribing colchicine.

- **Diabetes** - Steroids, such as prednisone or methylprednisolone, can raise blood sugar. They should be used with caution in patients with diabetes.

- **Organ tranpslant** - Organ transplants are complicated and patients who get them are often on a lot of carefully monitored medications. Adding new medications to the mix can be tricky. Always discuss with the patient's transplant team before prescribing new medications.

## <span id="interpretation">Interpretation</span>

Given that all the treatments for gout flares are basically equally effective,
FlareAid will provide what is generally considered the best treatment option in order of:

1. The least potential for harm to the patient
2. The cost and ease of access to the medication

There are circumstances when knowledgeable providers will knowingly and intentionally choose a treatment option that is not the best option according to FlareAid. This is fine. Flare treatment is typically
for a short duration and the potential for harm is low. However, it is important to be aware of the potential for harm and to discuss it with the patient.
