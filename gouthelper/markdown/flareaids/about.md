## <span id="about">About</span>

Every person who suffers from gout should have a plan, via a physician or otherwise, for treating a gout flare in the event he or she has one. FlareAids are a decision aid to help patients and providers make a customized plan for treating a gout flare. They interpret a patient's information and provide a recommendation for the best treatment option.

The treatments basically boil down to NSAIDs, which are available over the counter or by prescription, colchicine, or prednisone, the latter two of which are also available only by prescription in the US.

- NSAIDs are cheap, avilable over-the-counter, and generally well-tolerated. However, they should be used cautiously in patients who have cardiovascular diseases or any of a relatively long and hard-to-remember list of relative contraindications, even if for a short duration. Contraindications include anticoagulation, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, history of peptic ulcers or gastroinestinal bleeding, among many others.

- Colchicine should be cheap, but in the US it's not and is prescription only. In other countries it is cheap and readily available. It is generally well-tolerated. However, it can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly when used at higher doses for gout flares. It also has a long list of drug interactions, some of which are serious. It is also contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.

- Prednisone is sort of last resort, but is used all the time for gout flares. It's safe and cheap, but it's a steroid and has all the side effects that come with that. It canraise blood sugar, cause weight gain, and increase the risk of infections. It can also cause mood changes and insomnia. It's also not a great choice for patients with diabetes, but winds up being used in this circumstance not uncommonly due to lack of other options.
