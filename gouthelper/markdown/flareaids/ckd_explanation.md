CKD is a relative contraindication to NSAID use. However, short-term NSAIDs could be considered for acute gout flares in patients with CKD. Out of an abundance of caution, Gouthelper defaults to not recommending NSAIDs in the setting of CKD.

Colchicine is also metabolized (excreted) by the kidney and as a result, colchicine dosing is adjusted in individuals with CKD. Gouthelper defaults to not recommending colchicine in patients with CKD of unclear stage (severity) or advanced CKD (stage 4 or 5).
