Age greater than 65 is a relative contraindication to use of NSAIDs. This is due to a greater rate of side effects and adverse events in populations of individuals over age 65 using NSAIDs long-term for arthritis. Gouthelper's default is to not recommend against NSAIDs in this population because we screen heavily for other conditions that impart this increased risk in older individuals. Further, NSAIDs are highly effective for gout, are safe, and are inexpensive to buy over the counter.
