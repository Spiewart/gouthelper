Gout typically starts very quickly and symptoms peak within twelve hours after onset. It is often described as a "tickle" before bed that blossomed into such severe pain the following morning the patient cannot bear weight on the joint or brush it with a bed sheet.

A protracted, gradual onset makes gout less likely.
