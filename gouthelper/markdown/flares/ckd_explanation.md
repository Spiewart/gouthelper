Chronic kidney disease is a significant risk factor for gout because uric acid is excreted by the kidneys.

Gout was not included in the diagnostic rule for gout study. As a result, it doesn't play any role in our calculation of the gout prevalence in a population similar to the Flare reported.

GoutHelper includes CKD as a variable in Flare estimations of likelihood only to interpret pre-menopausal women who almost never experience gout in the absence of chronic kidney disease.
