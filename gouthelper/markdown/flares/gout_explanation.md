Having a history of gout is a risk factor for having more gout flares. This is supported by the Gout Diagnostic Rule study. This being said, everyone has gout has to have their first flare at some point.

One should also consider the possibility that what was thought to be a previous gout flare was actually something else. For example, if a patient had a previous flare that was diagnosed as gout, but was actually something else, this throws off Gouthelper's calculus.
