The first MTP (metatarsophalangeal) joint is the base of the big toe and is the most common joint in the body to be afflicted by gout. Having sudden onset pain and redness in this joint is always due to gout, though there are a few mimics.

Gout also commonly afflicts the other joints in the foot and ankles, the knee, the hand, wrist, and the elbow.

It is not at all common for gout to occur in the hip or wrist, and even more rarely in the spine.
