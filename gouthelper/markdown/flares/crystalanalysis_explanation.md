Crystal analysis is the method of taking fluid out of a joint and looking, with a microscope, for inflammatory crystals in the fluid.

This is done with a special microscope that has a polarizer to generate polarized light.

Several different varieties of crystals can be found this way, but in the case of gout, the crystal is monosodium urate.
