Men starting getting gout after puberty (around age 18). The incidence goes up thereafter and continues to rise for the entirety of the male lifespan.

The incidence of gout in women is extremely low until menopause, when it quickly starts to rise with age. Pre-menopausal women _almost_ never get gout unless they have CKD or other serious medical problems requiring medications that alter uric acid metabolism (like cyclosporine for an organ transplant).
