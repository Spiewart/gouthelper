## <span id="about">About</span>

The GoalUrate is a decision aid tool that determines what the goal uric acid is for a patient with gout who is on or initiating urate-lowering therapy. It is essentially how low providers should aim for the patient's uric acid to be when adjusting the dose of urate-lowering therapy.

The solubility of uric acid in the blood is 6.8 mg/dL[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). Guidelines recommend aiming for a reasonable amount lower than the solubility limit in order to make sure patients are consistently net negative uric acid.

## <span id="interpretation">Interpretation</span>

If the goal uric acid is 6.0 mg/dL, this means that the provider should aim for the patient's uric acid to be 6.0 mg/dL or lower when adjusting the dose of urate-lowering therapy. Similarly, if the goal uric acid is 5.0 mg/dL, this means that the provider should aim for the patient's uric acid to be 5.0 mg/dL or lower when adjusting the dose of urate-lowering therapy.
