## <span id="about">About</span>

Age is important for gout for several reasons. First, it helps establish an individual's risk of gout. Second, it potentially influences which medications are safest to use for one's gout treatment. And finally, it has a strong impact on kidney function, which in turns effects an individual's risk of gout and hsi or her medication dosing.

## <span id="dateofbirth">Date of Birth</span>

GoutHelper asks for age, not date of birth, because date of birth is considered protected health information (PHI). GoutHelper is not built to deal with PHI and instead keeps things generic and unidentifiable.

## <span id="flares">Flares</span>

Age is an important consideration when deciding whether or not a patient's symptoms are due to a gout flare or not. It is very rare for men to get gout until after puberty[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). Women typically don't get gout until after menopause, as estrogen causes urinary excretion of [uric acid](/labs/about/urate/) and protects them[<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2). There are exceptions for both sexes, such as when an individual has chronic kidney disease (CKD), is on a medication that lowers urinary uric acid excretion, or has rare inborn genetics that predispose him or her to gout.

## <span id="medications">Medications</span>

When considering what medications are safe for a patient, age needs to be considered for many. For gout, this is most important in the case of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([NSAIDs](/treatments/about/nsaids/)). Rates of NSAID-related adverse events go up quite a bit after age 65, and some providers prescribe NSAIDs cautiously or not at all in patients who are 65 or older[<sup>3</sup>](#ref-3). GoutHelper's defaults do not adopt this practice, but it is an important consideration none the less.

## <span id="egfr">Kidney Function</span>

Age is used to calculate kidney function<sup>[4](#ref-4)</sup>. Kidney function is very important for safely determining medication doses for several drugs used to treat gout, including the cornerstone treatment [ULT](/treatments/about/ult/). Kidney function also influences colchicine dosing, both for [flares](/treatments/about/flare/) and [prophylaxis](/treatments/about/ppx/).
