## <span id="about">About</span>

Lab testing is important in gout management for four reasons:

1. To help in the diagnosis of gout
2. To monitor the response to urate lowering therapy (ULT)
3. To monitor for adverse effects of gout medications
4. Checking the HLA-B\*5801 genotype prior to starting allopurinol

## <span id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</span>

A high serum uric acid level is not sufficient to diagnose gout, but it is strongly suggestive in
the appropriate circumstances. See the [urate](#urate) section for more information.

## <span id="urate">Urate</span>

Monitoring serum uric acid levels is important in gout management. The goal is to lower the serum uric acid level to the point that the body is net negative uric acid. See the [urate](/labs/about/urate/) page for more information.

## <span id="monitoring">Monitoring</span>

There is a risk of adverse effects with any medical treatment. While usually well tolerated, gout treatments are no exception. Clinicians typically monitor labs to detect adverse effects, particularly while a patient is just getting started on a new treatment regimen.

Typical labs that are monitored include:

- ALT (SGPT) and AST (SGOT), which are liver function tests
- CBC with differential
- Serum creatinine, which measures kidney function

The HLA-B*5801 allele is associated with a higher risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS)[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). See the [HLA-B*5801](/labs/about/hlab5801/) page for more information.
