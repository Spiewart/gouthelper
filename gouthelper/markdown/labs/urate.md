## <span id="about">About</span>

Uric acid, or urate for short, is the most important lab test in gout management. Urate chemistry is
what drives gout. Precursors to urate are called purines and are found in many foods. Urate is produced
by the body metabolising purines and is excreted by the kidneys[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). In gout, the body is creating more
urate than it is excreting. This leads to hyperuricemia, or a high serum uric acid level.

Hyperuricemia is a necessary but not sufficient condition for gout. Most people with hyperuricemia
do not develop gout.
