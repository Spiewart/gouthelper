## <span id="about">About</span>

Gender is important for evaluation and treatment of gout for two main reasons: 1. determining the likelihood that a patient's symptoms are due to gout ([flares](/flares/about/)), and 2. estimating kidney function to determine the safest medication dosing. As such, GoutHelper often needs to know the biological sex of GoutPatients in order to give accurate results. Needing to know biological sex is unavoidable GoutHelper appreciates the sensitive nature of birth-assigned sex and gender, but needs to know the former because of the importance of genetics and hormones for providing safe and accurate gout care.

## <span id="flares">Flares</span>

Biological sex is an important consideration when deciding whether or not a patient's symptoms are due to a gout flare or not. It is very rare for men to get gout until after puberty[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). Women typically don't get gout until after menopause, as estrogen causes urinary excretion of [uric acid](/labs/about/urate/) and protects them[<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2). There are exceptions for both sexes, such as when an individual has chronic kidney disease (CKD), is on a medication that lowers urinary uric acid excretion, or has rare inborn genetics that predispose him or her to gout.

## <span id="egfr">Kidney Function</span>

Biological sex is used to calculate kidney function<sup>[3](#ref-3)</sup>. Kidney function is very important for safely determining medication doses for several drugs used to treat gout, including the cornerstone treatment [ULT](/treatments/about/ult/). Kidney function also influences colchicine dosing, both for [flares](/treatments/about/flare/) and [prophylaxis](/treatments/about/ppx/).
