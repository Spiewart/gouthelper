## <span id="about">About</span>

Ult is a decision aid tool that determines if a patient has an indication for urate-lowering therapy ([ULT](/treatments/about/ult/)) and, if so, whether it is a strong or a conditional indication. It does not provide information about which urate-lowering therapy to use. For that, create a [UltAid](/ultaids/create/).

---

## <span id="methodology">Methodology</span>

The information needed to determine whether ULT is appropriate includes:

- **Number of Flares**: How many flares has the patient had?
- **Frequency of Flares**: How frequently does he or she get gout flares? Specifically, how many per flares per year?
- **Medical History**: Does the patient have any of the following:
  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
  - Urate kidney stones
  - Hyperuricemia (elevated blood uric acid)
  - Gouty erosions
  - Gouty tophi

The ULT will use this information to determine whether there is an indication for urate-lowering therapy or not. The American College of Rheumatology Guidelines for the Management of Gout[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1) are used to determine the strength of the indication.

## <span id="outcomes">Outcomes</span>

ULT outcomes are based in the GRADE methodology [<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2)<sup>, </sup>[<sup>3</sup>](#ref-3)<sup>, </sup>[<sup>4</sup>](#ref-4).

### <span id="strong">_Strong Indication_</span>

The panel of individuals writing the guidelines is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects.

- For patients — this means most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; request discussion if the intervention is not offered.
- For clinicians — most patients should receive the recommended course of action.

### <span id="conditional">_Conditional Indication_</span>

The panel writing the guidelines concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but is not confident.

- For patients — most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not.
- For clinicians — you should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that you must help each patient to arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences.

### <span id="notindicated">_Not Indicated_</span>

This means that the treatment is not appropriate for the patient.
