For patient's experiencing their first gout flare, it is conditionally recommended _not_ to start ULT. This based on less certain benefits relative to the risks of starting ULT. A case as example, an individual who has his or her first flare may go several years or indefinitely until he or she has another gout flare if beneficial lifestyle changes are made (healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, minimize alcohol and purine-rich foods, etc.)
