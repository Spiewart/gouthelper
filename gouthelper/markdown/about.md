Gouthelper is a hobby project developed by Dr. David Ewart, a rheumatologist in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The project started
during COVID-19 in 2019 as a way to learn Python and web development and to try to improve gout and the lives of patients with gout along the way. The project is open source and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Spiewart/gouthelper). The project is written predominantly in Python and uses the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework. Please check the readme on GitHub for more information on the project, including how to contribute.

## <span id="why-gouthelper">Why Gouthelper?</span>

Gout is pretty common and can be quite disabling. People miss activities, time with family, and work because of gout. The
treatments for gout a VERY effective, but they are not used as often as they should be and are often used incorrectly. Further,
there are a lot of misconceptions about gout that are a detriment
to getting it treated. Gouthelper is an attempt to help patients and providers get the most out of gout treatment.
