## <span id="what-is-it">What is GoutHelper</span>

GoutHelper is a web application to inform patients and providers about gout and contains a suite of tools that answers
common clinical questions in gout management like:

- [Flare](/flares/about/): Are the symptoms (joint pain, etc) due to gout?
- [FlareAid](/flareaids/about/): What [flare treatment](/treatments/about/flare/) is the best for a patient?
- [Ult](/ults/about/): Does a patient need [urate-lowering therapy](/treatments/about/ult/) (ULT)?
- [UltAid](/ultaids/about/): If so, what is the best choice of ULT?
- [GoalUrate](/goalurates/about/): What's the goal uric acid for monitoring ULT?
- [Ppx](/ppxs/about/): Is [prophylaxis](/treatments/about/ppx/) for gout flares needed?
- [PpxAid](/ppxaids/about/): If so, what is the best choice of prophylaxis?

## <span id="development">How was GoutHelper developed?</span>

GoutHelper is a hobby project developed by Dr. David Ewart, a rheumatologist in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The project started
during COVID-19 in 2019 as a way to learn Python and web development and to try to improve gout and the lives of patients with gout along the way. The project is open source and written predominantly in Python using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework. Please check the .readme on GitHub for more information on the project, including how to contribute.

## <span id="why-gouthelper">Why GoutHelper?</span>

Gout is pretty common and can be quite disabling. People miss activities, time with family, and work because of gout. The
treatments for gout are VERY effective, but they are not used as often as they should be and are often used incorrectly. Further,
there are a lot of misconceptions about gout that are a detriment
to getting it treated. GoutHelper is an attempt to help patients and providers get the most out of gout treatment.
