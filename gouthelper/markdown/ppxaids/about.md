## <span id="about">About</span>

PpxAids are a decision aid tool that determine the optimal choice of prophylaxis against gout flares for a given patient who is starting urate-lowering therapy (ULT). For advice on whether or not a patient needs prophylaxis, use a Ppx.

Prophylaxis is a medication taken daily to prevent gout flares. Any time a patient is started
on urate-lowering therapy (ULT), they actually have a higher risk of having a gout flare in the
short-term than if they had not started ULT. As a result, the American College of Rheumatology's 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Gout[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1) strongly recommends prophylaxis for all patients starting ULT (moderate strength recommendation).

Basically anyone who starts ULT has a guideline-based indication for prophylaxis. However, with more
modern slow and methodogical approaches to ULT, some groups studies suggest that prophylaxis may not
be required.

Typically, prophylaxis is done with the same medications that are used for treatment of gout flares,
just at lower doses. The most common options are: NSAIDs or colchicine, or less commonly prednisone.
