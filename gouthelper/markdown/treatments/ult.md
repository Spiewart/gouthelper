## <span id="basics">Basics</span>

ULT (urate-lowering therapy) is long-term treatment for gout. It is highly effective, in that
individuals who are on ULT typically should have their gout completely eliminated. ULT is not,
however, a cure. It needs to be taken indefinitely, or else the gout will return.
ULT is also **NOT** a treatment for gout flares.

## <span id="how-ult-works">How ULT Works</span>

ULT works by lowering the uric acid level in the blood. This is typically accomplished by
taking a medication that blocks the body's production of uric acid. Less commonly, a medication
that increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine is used. Uric acid deposits in joints,
where it can cause gout flares, over many years and takes time to be eliminated. Therefore,
goals are established for lowering a patient's blood uric acid level to a target level that
optimizes its elimination. If ULT is stopped, the uric acid level will rise again and gout
will return.

There are two main types of ULT: xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) and uricosurics. XOIs
block the production of uric acid, while uricosurics increase the excretion of uric acid in
the urine. The most commonly used ULT is allopurinol, which is a XOI. **Allopurinol** is the
cornerstone of ULT and is the first-line ULT for most patients. **Febuxostat** is another XOI
that is used when allopurinol is not tolerated or is not effective. It is more expensive
than allopurinol and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events
and death. Uricosurics are used when XOIs are not effective or are not tolerated. **Probenecid**
is the most commonly used uricosuric. It is less effective than allopurinol and has a higher
risk of side effects.

## <span id="monitoring">Monitoring</span>

ULT does require periodic lab monitoring. More frequent lab checks are required initially after
starting ULT, and less frequent lab checks are required once
the target uric acid level is reached and the ULT dose isn't being changed. Usually, labs are required
every 4-6 weeks initially, then every 3-6 months for a year or so, and then every 6-12 months.

Typical labs that are checked are the uric acid level, the complete blood count (CBC), kidney function via
creatinine, and liver function via liver enzymes. The uric acid level is what is used to titrate (i.e. adjust)
the ULT dose. The CBC is checked because all the ULT treatments can rarely cause drops in cell counts.
Creatinine is checked because XOI's are excreted by the kidney and need to be adjusted more slowly in
patients with less-than-perfect kidney function. Uricosurics are less effective in this situation as well.
LFTs (liver function tests) are checked because, as with most medications, ULT can rarely cause liver
injury.
