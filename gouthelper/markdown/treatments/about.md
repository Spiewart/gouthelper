## <span id="basics">Basics</span>

Gout treatment is divided into three parts:

1. [Flare](/treatments/about/flare/) treatment.
2. Urate-lowering therapy ([ULT](/treatments/about/ult/))
3. Prophylaxis against flares ([PPx](/treatments/about/ppx/))

## <span id="flare">Flare</span>

Flare treatment consists of anti-inflammatories that will reduce the duration and severity of a gout flare, but not eliminate it immediately. Usually these are given by mouth, but sometimes they are given by injection. For more information on Flare treatment, see [here](/treatments/about/flare/).

## <span id="ult">ULT</span>

ULT stands for urate-lowering therapy. This is the mainstay of gout treatment. It is the only treatment that can actually cure gout. For more information on ULT, see [here](/treatments/about/ult/).

## <span id="ppx">PPx</span>

PPx is short for prophylaxis, and what that means in the context of gout is medication that is taken to prevent gout flares. These generally reduce the chances of having a gout flare, but do not eliminate the risk entirely. For more information on PPx, see [here](/treatments/about/ppx/).
