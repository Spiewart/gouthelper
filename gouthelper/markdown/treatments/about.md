## <span id="basics">Basics</span>

Gout treatment is divided into three parts:

1. [Flare](/treatments/about/flare/) treatment.
2. Urate-lowering therapy ([ULT](/treatments/about/ult/))
3. Prophylaxis against flares ([PPx](/treatments/about/ppx/))

## <span id="flare">Flare</span>

Treatment of a gout flare is of imminent importance to anyone who has had or is having a gout flare. Flares are painful and disabling and need treatment, but they do typically go away on their own after a week or so. Flare treatment will reduce the duration and severity of a gout flare, but not eliminate it immediately. Flare treatments are all anti-inflammatories, typically taken as a pill(s), but sometimes they are given by injection. For more information on Flare treatment, see [here](/treatments/about/flare/).

## <span id="ult">ULT</span>

ULT stands for urate-lowering therapy. This is the mainstay of gout treatment. It is the only treatment that can actually cure gout. ULT reduces uric acid, which causes gout, in the body and joints. For more information on ULT, see [here](/treatments/about/ult/).

## <span id="ppx">PPx</span>

PPx is short for prophylaxis, and what that means in the context of gout is medication that is taken to prevent gout flares. These generally reduce the chances of having a gout flare, but do not eliminate the risk entirely. For more information on PPx, see [here](/treatments/about/ppx/).
