HLA-B\*58:01 is a gene that is a risk factor for hypersensitivity to allopurinol, which can be serious. Certain ethnicities have a higher prevalence of this gene, including Han Chinese, Thai, African American, and Korean. The American College of Rheumatology recommends checking individuals of these descents for this gene before starting allopurinol. If the gene is present, the individual should not be started on allopurinol as first line ULT therapy. If the gene has not been checked, alternative therapies should be first line.

The default settings for Gouthelper are to contraindicate allopurinol in the setting of a high-risk ethnicity and without any testing having been done for HLA-B\*58:01. If the gene has been checked and is negative, allopurinol is not contraindicated.
