Febuxostat was associated with an increased rate of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in late-stage clinical trials in which it was compared to allopurinol. Thus it should be used cautiously in patients with risk factors for or pre-existant cardiovascular disease and as a second line therapy relative to allopurinol. However, given a patient with no other options for urate-lowering therapy, it should not be withheld for this reason.
