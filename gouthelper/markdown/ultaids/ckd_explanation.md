CKD is NOT a contraindication to ULT. However, the dose of ULT should be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. Fluctuations in renal function should not be used as a reason to stop or even reduce the dose of ULT in a patient on previously stable doses. Conversely, worsening renal function often necessitates increasing ULT doses to compensate for less uric acid excretion.

Regarding probenecid: it is not recommended in patients with CKD stage 4 or 5. Gouthelper defaults to not recommending it in patients with CKD of unclear stage (severity).
