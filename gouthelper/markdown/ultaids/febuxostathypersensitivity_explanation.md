While not as well described as that of allopurinol, febuxostat hypersensitivity does occur and is also a potentially life-threatening condition. Any history of febuxostat hypersensitivity should be documented and preclude further use of febuxostat. Like allpurinol, for less severe cases, some individuals can be de-sensitized to febuxostat. This should be done under the direction of a rheumatologist.
