While not very common, medication interactions with ([XOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine_oxidase_inhibitors) can be very serious. The most effective and most commonly used drugs for ULT, allopurinol and febuxostat, are both XOIs. The most common interacting medications are azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, which are used for autoimmune diseases and organ transplant. When unknowingly used together, these medications can cause severe bone marrow suppression in addition to several other serious side effects. Theophylline, a medication that used to be used for asthma and COPD, can also interact with XOI's and cause toxicity.
