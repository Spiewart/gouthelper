A patient who is on prophylaxis for gout flares does not need to continue prophylaxis forever. The optimal
duration of prophylaxis treatment isn't agreed upon or based on good evidence. The rationale is based on
participants in clinical trials who are started on ULT having more flares relative to participants who were on placebo in the first 3-6 months of the trials.

The American College of Rheumatology recommends that patients receive 3-6 months of prophylaxis after achieving goal uric acid levels. GoutHelper defaults to 6 months of prophylaxis after achieving goal uric acid, but this can be abbreviated or extended on a provider-by-patient basis. Additionally, patients with gouty tophi have larger deposits of uric acid in their
bodies and may have flares for longer after having achieved goal uric acid. In these cases, prophylaxis may be extended to 12 months or longer.
