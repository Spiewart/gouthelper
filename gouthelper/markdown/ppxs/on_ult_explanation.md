Prophylaxis was developed and scientifically validated in individuals who are starting urate-lowering therapy. For patients who are already on ULT, the use of prophylaxis is not well studied. However, it is reasonable to consider prophylaxis in patients who have had a history of gout flares with initiation of ULT and who are either still having flares or who are still hyperuricemic. It should _not_ be used in patients who have been at goal uric acid for 6 months or longer, unless they have gouty tophi, in which case consideration could be given to continuing it until the tophi have largely resolved.
