Patients who are still experiencing gout flares while on urate-lowering therapy have most likely not been at goal uric acid long enough to totally eliminate flares. Long enough is generally considered 6 months or longer, and patients should stay on prophylaxis until their uric acid has been consistently under 6.0 mg/dL for 3-6 months.

Patients who have gouty tophi may take considerably longer to eliminate all of the body's excess uric acid stores and completely prevent flares. Such patients may need stay on prophylaxis until their tophi have largely resolved.

If a patient is still experiencing flares after being at goal uric acid for 6 months or longer, providers should also question whether or not his or her symptoms of flares are due to another condition (e.g., osteoarthritis, pseudogout, etc.)
