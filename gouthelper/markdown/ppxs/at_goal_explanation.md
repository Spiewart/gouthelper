Prophylaxis is continued until a patient is at [goal uric acid](/goalurates/about/) for 3-6 months per ACR guidelines. The goal uric acid is either 5.0 mg/dL or 6.0 mg/dL, depending on the patient's characteristics (see [GoalUrate](/goalurates/create/)).

If a patient's uric acid status is not known, that has to be remedied. Otherwise providers will not have any way of knowing
whether a patient is at continued risk of having gout flares, or whether their ULT dosing is correct for that matter.
