## <span id="about">About</span>

Ppx is short for prophylaxis and, in the context of Gouthelper, is a tool to determine whether a patient
should be on [prophylaxis](/treatments/about/ppx/) against gout flares. Prophylaxis is generally
used in patients who are starting ULT. The rationale for this is that ULT can actually increase the risk
of gout flares in the short-term, so prophylaxis is used to prevent this. It does not need to be continued indefinitely.

## <span id="indications">Indications</span>

Anyone who is _starting_ ULT has a guideline-based indication for prophylaxis per the
[2020 ACR guidelines](#ref-1).

The guidelines are not as clear about patients who are already on ULT but who need to have their ULT
titrated because they are having flares and/or are hyperuricemic. Gouthelper defaults to recommending prophylaxis in these instances, but this is not addressed in the guidelines or really in the scientific
literature. We believe that, from the patient's perspective, fewer flares is better than more flares. In
this context, prophylaxis is very optional.

If the patient is not on ULT, there is no role for prophylaxis. Prophylaxis of gout flares without ULT
is misguided.

## <span id="when-to-stop">When to Stop</span>

Prophylaxis should be continued until the uric acid has been at goal for at least 3-6 months. This is typically done by checking the uric acid on an every 1-2-3 month basis while ULT is being titrated. Some
individuals who have gouty tophi, which are essentially dense deposits of monosodium urate, may need to
be on prophylaxis for longer. This is because the tophi can take a long time to dissolve, and the
dissolution of tophi is associated with a risk of flares.
