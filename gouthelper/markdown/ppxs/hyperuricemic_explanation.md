Being hyperuricemic means a patient is definitely still at risk for gout flares. Individuals who are hyperuricemic and starting urate-lowering therapy should generally be started on gout flare prophylaxis and continued on it until they are no longer hyperuricemic (serum uric acid > 6.0 mg/dL) for 3-6 months.

While not addressed specifically in the guidelines because it is not well studied, Gouthelper defaults to recommending prophylaxis for individuals who are on ULT already but are also hyperuricemic. This is due to their risk of having gout flares.
